        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Carne de Porco à Alentejana (Pork with clams) is one of the most traditional and popular pork dishes of Portuguese cuisine.<br> 
        It is a combination of pork and clams, with potatoes and coriander. Although this dish has the name of the Alentejo region in its name, it is believed<br>
        that it was invented in the Algarve region.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients (For 2 people)</h2>
            500g pork loin<br>
            2 garlic cloves - crushed<br>
            2tsp massa de pimentão (Pepper paste, widely available in Portuguese supermarkets)<br>
            2 bay leaves<br>
            1/2tsp smoked paprika<br>
            400ml of a good white wine<br>
            Salt and black pepper to taste<br>
            2 large potatoes<br>
            1tbsp olive oil<br>
            500g clams<br>
            Fresh cilantro<br>

        <h2>Preparation</h2>
            <p>Cut the pork into approximately 3cm cubes and place in a bowl or deep dish.</p>
            <p>Add the wine, crushed garlic cloves, bay leaves, pepper paste and paprika to the dish.</p>
            <p>Mix thoroughly and be sure the pork is covered well.</p>
            <p>Cover, and leave to marinade for at least 2 hours.</p>
            <p>While the pork is marinating, we can prepare our clams. Place them in a large bowl and cover them with cold salted water.<br>
                You'll want to leave them for at least an hour. The clams which should be alive will start to breathe and begin to filter the water.<br>
                This should push the older saltwater and sand out of their shells. You'll notice the water get pretty murky.</p>
            <p>With the pork marinated, separate the pork and keep the marinade. Sear the pork in a hot pan.</p>
            <p>Once all of the pork is seared, pour the remaining marinade on top of the pork. Let it simmer with a lid for around 45 minutes.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, peel and cut the potatoes into small cubes.</p>
            <p>Give them a nice coating of olive oil and salt and spread them on a baking tray. Place them in the oven at 200°.<br>
                Cook them in the oven for around 30-40 minutes until they're golden brown.</p>
            <p>Drain the clams into a large colander or sieve, remove any with broken shells, or any clams that don't close when you touch them</p>
            <p>If you've timed this correctly, we should be reaching the point where everything is nearly ready, the clams will only need around 5 minutes<br>
                so pause here if your potatoes aren't quite done.</p>
            <p>Place all of the clams into the pan with the pork. Use a lid and let the clams, steam/simmer in the liquid.<br>
                They'll take around 5 to 7 minutes to cook and open.</p>
            <p>While the clams are cooking, spread your potatoes evenly on a plate.</p>
            <p>Once the clams are cooked, discard any that did not open.<br>
                We think its best to remove about half of the clams from their shells and leave them in the sauce.</p>
            <p>Spoon the pork, clams and plenty of the sauce on top of the potato base layer! Sprinkle with fresh coriander.</p>
        <p><strong>Serve and enjoy!</strong></p>
